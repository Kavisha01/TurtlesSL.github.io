                                <li>Along the southeast coast of the United States, hundreds of hatchling turtles leave their nests each year and 
                                    swim into the Atlantic Ocean. Sadly, just one in 1,000 to 10,000 people will reach maturity. Young and adult sea 
                                    turtles confront incredible natural challenges, but it is the growing risks brought on by humans that are putting them in
                                     danger of going extinct. Except for the loggerhead, which is designated as threatened, all sea turtles found in American waters
                                      are now federally listed as endangered. </li>
                                    
                                   
                                
                                <li>Worldwide, six of the seven sea turtle species are classified as threatened or endangered due to human actions and lifestyles.
                                     From getting caught in fishing gear to people eating their meat and eggs, there are lots of ways that these animals are affected by people.</li>

                                 a result of fishing. Turtles collected in gill nets, trawls, and long lines are released as bycatch.
                                  Even those that manage to avoid fishing nets endure harm because their food supply and environment are disturbed. </P>

                                        <li> Eliminate marine trash that could entangle or unintentionally ingest sea turtles.</li>
                                        <li>  Help preserve our beaches and ocean clean by taking part in coastal cleanups and reducing your use of plastic.
                                             Sea turtles and other marine life could be harmed by trash in the water.</li>
                                        <li>  Bring your own shopping bags and reusable water bottles. Avoid releasing balloons into the 
                                            air because they will probably wind up in the water where sea turtles may mistake them for prey and eat them.</li>
                                        <li>    Preserve sea turtle safety and darkness on nesting beaches. Turn off, cover, 
                                            or reroute any lights that can be seen from the shore. Sea turtle hatchlings are confused by lights, and females that are nesting are 
                                            deterred from coming to the shore to lay their eggs.</li>
                                        <li>    Keep nesting turtles, nests, and hatchlings undisturbed. Participate in organized sea turtle watch programs
                                             that understand how to monitor breeding sea turtles safely.</li>
                                        <li>   In order to prevent sea turtles from being turned away, remove recreational beach equipment including chairs, umbrellas,
                                             and boats at night.</li>
                                        <li>    Before you leave the beach, patch up any holes and destroy any sandcastles. They could become a barrier for hatchlings
                                             or turtles that are building nests.</li>
